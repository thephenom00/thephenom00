ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid programmer, lifelong learner, and adventurer currently studying at the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague. I find fulfillment in software development because of satisfaction I get by solving complex problems.

If you would like to discuss potential collaborations, exchange ideas, or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email. 

I'd love to hear from you!
